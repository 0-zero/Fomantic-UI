# Semantic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI)
Semantic uses principles of natural language to create a re-usable language for UI.

Semantic UI is now at 1.0, **be sure to check out our [release notes](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/blob/master/RELEASE%20NOTES.md) for changes from the pre-release**.

> Community contributed plugins and ports for Wordpress, Angular, Dart, Knockout, Rails, and more can be found on the [Integration page](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/wiki/Integration).
