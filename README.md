*NOTE:* Fomantic was created to continue active development of Semantic-UI and has the intent to be merged back into the master repository once active development can restart. For more info please read the following issues https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6109 https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6413

Key Features
* 50+ UI elements

* 3 Levels of variable inheritance (similar to SublimeText)

Semantic allows developers to build beautiful websites fast, with **concise HTML**, **intuitive javascript**, and **simplified debugging**, helping make front-end development a delightful experience. Semantic is responsively designed allowing your website to scale on multiple devices. Semantic is production ready and partnered with frameworks such as **React**, **Angular**, **Meteor**, and **Ember**, which means you can integrate it with any of these frameworks to organize your UI layer alongside your application logic.
