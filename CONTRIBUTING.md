# Contributing 

## Introduction

There are a variety of ways to contribute to the development of Semantic. We are a very new project and are looking for an enthusiastic and like-minded group of core contributors. We use the lovely free project management software [Trello](https://trello.com/jack148/recommend) for keeping track of project issues and updates.

Some Trello boards are open publicly, others are limited to contributors. Anyone can share ideas for the direction of the project using our public boards.

If you are looking to be added to contributor board on Semantic and are active in development, please reach out to me by e-mail [jack@myfav.es](mailto:jack@myfav.es)

### Publicity

One of the easiest ways to support Semantic UI is to get the word out

## Making Semantic Better

### Bugs & Issues

Please submit any bugs you encounter when using the library to our [Github Issues Tracker](https://github.com/jlukic/Semantic-UI/issues?state=open).

When submiting a bug report, please include a set of steps to reproduce the issue and any related information, browser, OS etc. If we can't see the issue then it will make solving things much more difficult.

Please create a fork of this [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/efp8z6Ln/) to demonstrate bugs.

### Style Guide

Contributors should read over the coding guidelines for the project. Most importantly, the guide for language, as it is one of the most important parts about Semantic UI.

### Pull Requests

Anyone can jump on the issues board and grab off bugs to fix. This is probably the best way to become a contributor to Semantic. Be sure to adhere to the style guides when submitting code.
