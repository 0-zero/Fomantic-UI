  ✔ Submitting Bugs and Enhancements.
	Before submitting a bug make sure you do the following:
	
	- Check out our contributing guide for info on our release cycle.
	
	- Fork our boilerplate JSFiddle to create a test case for your bug.
	  If a bug is apparent in the docs, that's ok as a test case, just
	  make it clear exactly how to reproduce the issue. Only bugs that
	  include a test case can be triaged.
	  
	  
  ✔ Pull Requests
    When adding pull requests, be sure to merge into the next branch.
	If you need to demonstrate a fix in next release, you can use our
	JSFiddle.
	
	
	
	If your bug uses a third party framework like Ember, Meteor, or Angular.
	Be sure to submit the issue to their respective issues boards. If you
	are confident the bug is part of the 'vanilla' SUI release, keep in mind
	not all maintainers are familiar with all framework and a simple test
	case is greatly appreciated.

	Make sure you name your issue correctly!
	
	Semantic UI boards use a special naming convention to help tag issue titles by the component
	the issue is related to.

	Bugs
	Please tag titles in the format "[Component] Sub-type should do correct behavior". Please use
	standard title case for titles, including the bracketed tag.

	For example
      [Dropdown] Multiple Selection Should Preserve "Set Selected" Order
	  [Validation] - E-mail Validation Should Handle Cyrillic
	  [Button] - Grouped Buttons Should Display Correctly on Mobile
	
	
	Enhancements
	For new feature requests, you can use the format "[Component] Add new feature"

	For example
	  [Dropdown] Add "Clearable" Setting
	  [Validation] Add Rules for Zipcode Validation
	  [API] Add "onProgress" callback setting
